      <h3> Why I took this class:</h3>
      <p> I took this class because I want to learn how to program. I have a couple of friends that know some programming languages like HTML and Java. They were my inspiration to take this class because I aspire to reach or possibly exceed them in programming. This class would certainly be a big help. I also wanted to be one of the first people to take the class since this is the first tme it is being offered to a public school in Hawai'i </p>
    
      <h3> What I want to get out of this class:</h3>
      <p> By the end of this school year, I want to be able to program fluently in at least two programming languages. I also want to be able to program a robot for First Robotics Competition (FRC) using Java.  </p>
