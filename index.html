          <h3> Why I took this class:</h3>
          <p> I took this class because I want to learn how to program. I have a couple of friends that know some programming languages like HTML and Java. They were my inspiration to take this class because I aspire to reach or possibly exceed them in programming. This class would certainly be a big help. I also wanted to be one of the first people to take the class since this is the first tme it is being offered to a public school in Hawai'i

For example, a good user experience would be a website that is easy to navigate, isn't cluttered, and has a logical flow of links and bodies of text. With these traits, the user would have a pleasant time browsing throught the site.
