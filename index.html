          <h3 class="header"> Why I took this class:</h3>
          <p> I took this class because I want to learn how to program. I have a couple of friends that know some programming languages like HTML and Java. They were my inspiration to take this class because I aspire to reach or possibly exceed them in programming. This class would certainly be a big help. I also wanted to be one of the first people to take the class since this is the first time it is being offered to a public school in Hawai'i

          <p> <span class="highlight"> By the end of this school year, </span>I want to be able to program fluently in at least two programming languages. I also want to be able to program a robot for First Robotics Competition (FRC) using Javascript. Doing so would allow me to utilize what I learned and make a contribution to my robotics team.

          <h3 class="header"> Difference Between UX and UI</h3>
          <p>
            UX stands for User Experience. It deals with organization, layout, etc. Essentially, it's how the user interacts with a website. For example, a good user experience would be a website that is easy to navigate, isn't cluttered, and has a logical flow of links and bodies of text. With these traits, the user would have a pleasant time browsing throught the site.

            UI stands for User Interface. The user interface deals with the aesthetic aspect of website. It can include color

        <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>

          <p>
            I feel that I am learning HTML and CSS at a decent pace. The logic behind the commands in CSS is easy to understand. As for HTML, I can make sense of most of the tags, but I think I need to memorize the tags and their funcitonality in order to be able to use HTML proficiently. Sublime text has been helpful due to being able to shortcut and see the color coded text. I don't think I'd be able to distinguish between certain commands without it. I'll go more into detail about how I feel about both languages.

            HTML
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most of the tags such as "p," "class," and "id," make sense  because they are self explanatory. Personally, the most difficult aspect of HTML is typing out the code and deciding which elements to give a class or id. Formatting can be done through logic. I've found that hitting the "Enter" key in the right places makes the different elements stand out.

            CSS
          </h3>
          <p>
            CSS is easy to understand but there's also some information that needs to be known in order to format a website to one's liking. For example, there's the difference between margin, border, and padding, and how specifications for each are inputted. Since I'm a beginner I went through a lot of trial and error in an attempt to change the sizes of the margin and what not.
