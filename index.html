      <h3> Why I took this class:</h3>
      <p> I took this class because I want to learn how to program. I have a couple of friends that know how to some programming languages like HTML and Java. This class would certainly be a big help. I also found it interesting that this would be the first time that it would offered to a public school in Hawai'i, so I wanted to be part of its history.</p>

      <h3> What I want to get out of this class:</h3>
      <p> By the end of this school year,    I want to be able to program fluently in at least two programming languages. I also want to be able to program a robot for a robotics competition using Java. </p>
